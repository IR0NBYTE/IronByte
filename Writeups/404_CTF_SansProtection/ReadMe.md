Before we start you need to download the binary from here : [Binary](./fragile).

Here we go, let's start by checking the architecture of the binary with : 
```console
file fragile
```
We get : 

````bash
fragile: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=6a457609506482cdebb144dbacd9c1f6fba34955, stripped
